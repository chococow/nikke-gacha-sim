# nikke-gacha-sim
Forked from Spelljinxer (https://github.com/Spelljinxer/nikke-gacha-sim). Only forked to add RedHood into the Pilgrim character pool to feed 1 yr anni gambling addiction.
////
A website to simulate gacha pulls based on NIKKE. This simulator allows you to simulate gacha pulls and manage character inventory (WIP).
It provides functionality for both single pulls and 10-pull gacha draws. 

(The CLI version is now archived into the CLI folder).

# TODO
- [ ] Inventory System
  - maybe a display popup window??
- [x] Multiple Banners (ordinary, limited, collab, etc.) (sort of done, just need to add the pages)
